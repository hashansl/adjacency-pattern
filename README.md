# Topological Data Analysis: Simplicial Complex Adjacency Method for Geospatial Spread Analysis

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains an implementation of topological data analysis using the simplicial complex adjacency method to study the spread of phenomena in a geospatial context. The primary focus is on a 4 by 4 square grid, providing a compact yet illustrative scenario for analyzing the dynamics of spreading processes.

## Features

- **Simplicial Complex Representation**: Explore the topological structure of the geospatial data through simplicial complexes, offering a powerful mathematical framework for capturing connectivity and relationships.
  
- **Adjacency Method**: Utilize the adjacency method to model the interactions between different regions in the 4 by 4 square grid. This method facilitates the understanding of how phenomena propagate and influence neighboring areas.

- **Geospatial Visualization**: Leverage geospatial visualization techniques to represent the evolving patterns of spread on the grid. Visual outputs can aid in the interpretation of complex dynamics and trends.

- **Scalability Testing**: Assess the scalability of the methodology by experimenting with different parameters and grid sizes. Evaluate the robustness of the approach in handling larger datasets.
